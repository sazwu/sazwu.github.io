      <p>Hello! I’m Sara Wu, a CS undergrad studying at the University of Washington in Seattle. Though I don’t know where my path will take me, I take particular interest in machine-learning and artificial intelligence. I’m also looking to potentially pursue a degree in philosophy, whether that be a double major or an ethics minor.</p>
      <p>My interest in programming started when I participated in a Girls Who Code summer immersion session at Autodesk SF in 2019. There we were introduced to coding basics through Scratch, Python, web development, and Arduino. For our final project, my team created a political alignment quiz for 2020’s upcoming presidential candidates. As lead programmer, I used RenPy, a Python-based visual novel creation program, that allowed for a narration-based, interactive experience. The next summer, I elected to take an Intro to Java course at my local community college, as well as self-study for the AP Computer Science A exam. During my senior year, I once again utilized RenPy for our annual senior project, where two of my classmates and I created a visual novel video game, complete with an original story and illustrations.</p>
      <p>In terms of personal projects, I created a basic Discord bot that interacts with server users and responds to their messages. In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, and struggling to longboard.</p>
