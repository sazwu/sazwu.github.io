      <p>Hey there, I’m Sara Wu, an undergrad studying Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. ~ヾ(・ω・)</p>
      <p>My foray into tech and CS was through a Girls Who Code’s summer immersion program at Autodesk SF in 2019. There, I not only developed a strong coding foundation, but also a desire to improve equity and outreach for minorities in tech. 
        During college, my time is mostly spent contributing robot controls code for Advanced Robotics at the University of Washington (ARUW), as well as for their open-source controls library and framework, taproot. ARUW competes in the university sector of the robotics competition RoboMaster. Starting Fall 2022, I’ll be supporting incoming members as a Software Lead for the Controls team. Additionally, I’ll also be a teaching assistant for one of UW’s introductory CS courses CSE 122, as well as a resident advisor for the engineering Living Learning Community (LLC) dorms.</p>
      <p>In my freetime I’m an avid reader who prefers books about unexpected heroes with varying senses of humor, as well as a foreign-language television junkie who loves crime dramas. Outside of my house, I love exploring through either public transport or my own two legs, as well as playing badminton and taking pictures of unsuspecting animals. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ </p>
